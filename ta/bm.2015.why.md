Why are we Here? Why BitShares? Why this community? Why Me?

Why, why, why? 

From time to time I find it necessary to reflect on where we have been, what we have accomplished, and where we are going. In the middle of all of the chaos it is easy to lose sight of our purpose. Everything we do we do for a reason, but if we are not careful short term 'reasons' can cause us to take actions that are not in line with our big picture reasons.

Crytpocurrency was originally created out of a desire to break-free from the slavery created by the combination of fiat money and a legal system that outlawed private solutions such as (egold and liberty dollar).  

This product found a market among a small segment of the population and they have taken the concept of Bitcoin and created a speculative bubble.  This speculative bubble in turn has attracted people with *different reasons* for being interested in cryptocurrency, the short term gold rush.

BitShares was originally created out of a desire to solve a problem that Bitcoin faced (exchange with fiat) under the presumption that the governments would eventually shutdown the exchanges like they did egold and liberty dollar. With each day that passes it seems less and less likely that governments will shut down these exchanges. They are being regulated and given rules to follow that allow them to stay in business.

This means that BitShares original reason for existence (to provide the decentralized exchange) in a world where Bitcoin is being cracked down upon is less and less relevant. 


Instead we are put in a situation of competing head-to-head with centralized exchanges which are trusted, fast, and legal.  

In the process of attempting to attract "exchange users" who are ultimately just "speculators" we have lost sight of our original customer: the person who wants freedom from the financial system.

My mission in life has been to find free market solutions to secure life, liberty, and property. Systems that are so powerful and effective that they can render governments irrelevant. This is something that I am very passionate about and the reason why I believe most of your are here and loyal to BitShares.


 If we lose sight of this particular vision we lose our core belief, our mission, our "why".   And without a reason why we are adrift chasing profits and losing hope when they don't come quickly enough.

Clearly a system that aims to secure life, liberty, and property must be profitable and provide incentives to attract normal users who could care less about our philosophy. 

These profits will come eventually, but in the short term we need to ask ourselves what "features" do our core users actually need to secure their liberty? How are regular users currently vulnerable to government interference? How can we produce tools that empower the average Joe to take a stance and make a difference?

Here is how the average BitShares user is vulnerable and is still being victimized by governments:

1. Their activity is too public, easily tracked, and their profits/losses easily reported to the various taxing agencies. In this sense BitShares is contributing to enslavement.
2.  Attempting to do commerce with untrusted parties is still difficult (lack of simple escrow and dispute resolution).
3.  Lack of tools for building reputations, bonding users, etc
4.  Lack of tools to support and encourage civil disobedience and peaceful tax protests

The people interested in this particular market are few and far between (1% or less of the population), but they are passionate and desperate for tools and willing to try anything. These people are willing to pay significant money to gain their freedom.

Unfortunately, if BitShares starts to go in this particular direction it will scare away those who want "mainstream adoption NOW!".  Banks will not touch it. Merchants will think twice. Governments will crack down.

BitShares has solved many problems that put it in a unique position among all other crypto projects. It is fast, efficient, clean, and most importantly has the gift of self-governeance and self-funding. This is a very solid foundation upon which to build a larger movement. A foundation that is more robust than any other platform.

The reason why we want to gain exchange users is to accomplish a higher mission than just profit. If we focus on being a payment / exchange solution then we have 100's of competitors many of which are better suited to meet the needs of the masses. If we focus on being a platform for freedom then we have almost no competitors and can start a larger movement.

We all have needs that must be met (food, shelter, clothing for ourselves and family). These needs demand we provide value to the market each day. It is easy to lose sight of our goal in the middle these daily demands. Our objective gets short-sighted, focused on the next dollar rather than the grand vision.

I am all for helping BitShares earn a living from the exchange business, but the exchange business is just a day-job.  The exchange is not our reason, our why. 

If we lead with our Why, then people will join our movement and we will grow and never die.  If we lead with our How (Blockchain/BitShares) and our What (exchange) then we will forever struggle against competitors because users have no deeper reasons to stay with us.

I have shared this link before, but I will share it again:
https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en

So I ask each of you, Why are you here? Why do you support BitShares? And how does the Fee Debate, Exchange vs Payment Debate, actually support your Reason for being here?

Thank you for the context. It is important to remember where we are and where we have come from. I agree with you about the WHY being fundamental, but that does not mean we cannot have a sustainable product. It seems like every time we have almost gotten there, the plan has changed a bit and people have been left holding the bag and awaiting the next incarnation. Each incarnation has been far better than what came before and I am thankful for what your team is developing; don't get me wrong. But I'd like to see it come to a usable fruition, especially to thank so many members of the community who have funded or worked hard on these development efforts. If there is a robust trading engine which will attract an exchange business, and if that is simple enough to create from the point we're at now, then please do it. We are most of the way there already.

From there, more possibilities will open up. I think that the WHY will have far more support behind it and that the community will be able to do far more with it if there is a successful product and exchange as its basis. If this thing succeeds, the world will be at your fingertips. It's not just the money; it's the legitimacy and a stepping stone to greater opportunities and open doors, whether these be in the realms of finance, social change, business, politics, or whatever calling each of us has to help solve problems and make a better world.

Lol that Ted Talk has been around for years... Just because Apple got popular, this guy thought he new the reasons why.  There is still a lot up for interpretation.  Big wigs at some big companies have tried to emulate this exact Ted Talk.  The results have been mixed judging by profits and share price.  Also this "why" thing is what all these little venture funded tech companies are using to get funded.  Doesn't matter that they have no profits and are losing money daily, they think the "why" will bring customers in... Fact is it won't.  Once people start realizing these little companies will never turn a profit but they are valued in the billions, things will change and people are going to lose tons of money.  The only "why" being asked will be "why the hell did I buy into that stupid sales pitch".

How this relates to bitshares-

If you take your eye off the exchange ball now, we are legitimately screwed.  You might think we can never compete with centralized exchanges, but just look at what happened when the peg was removed from the EUR/CHF... numerous brokers went out of business!  That would never ever happen with bitshares!

There is a real fear among forex traders, that eventually the markets will be taken away.  That people won't be able to make money from swings of volatility and that speculators are evil.  These same forex traders would love to trade and even pay a premium for something that eliminates this risk. BITSHARES IS THAT SOMETHING!!

We are so so close to getting this right.  Please don't change the plan before:

1.Trading fees are updated
2.Referral trading fees are possible
3.API for 3rd parties is ready.

I know we love to fuck ourselves over in this community... but all we have to do is stay the course this one time, and you will have all the funds to implement anything you want.

I respect all the work you and your team has contributed to the project, however, the constant shifting sands is one of the reasons people have left our ecosystem.   Let's get a stable decentralized exchange, great APIs, clean wallet to take advantage of our amazing smartcoins first.   Let's have a piece of the project we can show that doesn't take a PhD in economics or computer science to understand.

Once that liquidity starts coming in, all those other points make sense to me. Stay the course.

I agree with your speech on the part that when BitShares has those core features and has attracted the users that indeed, seek liberty and their right to privacy, those users will never leave BitShares again and will stay loyal. I have no doubt about that. However on the following part

Quote from: bytemaster on November 19, 2015, 09:02:11 pm

    These profits will come eventually, but in the short term we need to ask ourselves what "features" do our core users actually need to secure their liberty?



My thinking is exactly the opposite. What core users need to secure their liberty is profit at the moment. So you can eventually add all the features they need and even create something new and better that is non existent at the moment. With no profit you can't secure the liberty you (and all of us I guess) want so much. The features you want to implement are directly dependent on whether BitShares is profitable or not. No profit means people won't vote for expensive feature implementation.

Maybe the core users would vote for this and stay loyal to the end, but most of the user's won't approve of this if they see the amount of BitShares continually increasing in order to fund non profitable features. That's the problem. People chase money. While you need to think on core users, you need to think on the rest simply because without them BitShares has way less chance of succeeding. I'm not saying they're right or not. I'm just saying you need to take that into consideration. You spook them, they go away, BitShares' chances decrease. You need to consider the masses and the influence they might have on the future of BitShares or not, because without them you won't have the money for the features and liberty you want to achieve. The core users won't pay for all the features for sure, they dont have the money. Masses do. This means - unfortunately - that you depend on them to achieve liberty.

I agree with these points. I'm a little confused at the purpose of this post. The WHY is very important to keep in context, and I don't think anyone's lost sight of that. Most important now is determining the HOW. Bitshares is at a very pivotal point. This project could very well fail and with it extinguish this vision of freedom that you have conceived. To ensure that it doesn't, we need to be concerned about generating greater usership, even more mainstream adoption, because the more people that we have utilizing these tools the more people will begin to exercise their capacity for choice, and the stronger we will collectively be. That means that we have to decide upon the fee schedule, that means we have to provide a competitive exchange experience. All these things are important in order to ultimately reach the WHY. The debates around these aspects of operation and the consensus generated from all coincide with realizing the WHY.

    1. Their activity is too public, easily tracked, and their profits/losses easily reported to the various taxing agencies. In this sense BitShares is contributing to enslavement.
    2.  Attempting to do commerce with untrusted parties is still difficult (lack of simple escrow and dispute resolution).
    3.  Lack of tools for building reputations, bonding users, etc
    4.  Lack of tools to support and encourage civil disobedience and peaceful tax protests


While I agree with liberty, I don't endorse the "tax protest" part. I think the main danger or risk is not going to be from the government, it's going to come from cyber criminals who will find the rich list and then try to extort everyone on it. At that point the target list is going to be obvious, and the net worths for all to see, which puts people in danger not from the government, but from organized crime.

So basically while I agree with implementing privacy I think you have to market it more objectively. In a world without privacy everyone will be a victim to organized crime because anonymous currencies are going to exist regardless of if we want them to or not and privacy  has to be used to increase the ability of the property owner to secure ownership of his or her property.

As for tax protesting and the IRS, I don't support tax evasion. It's better to pay the taxes in terms of lowering risks, than to not pay them. I'm talking about it from a risk perspective and not from an ideological or passion perspective. From a risk perspective, there should always be an option available for people who would like to lower their risk in a certain area or way, but if people want to increase their risks then that option should be open to them but it should probably not be directly connected to Bitshares because not every user wants to protest in high risk ways.

On reputation, on financial independence, I pretty much agree, because both lead to liberty, but both don't break any laws or increase the risks associated with using Bitshares. It's part of the job of developers to lower the risks the participants have to take to use Bitshares, so the design has to in my opinion be approached in such a way that the user is always free to accept or limit the amount of legal risk or any other kind of security risk they take.

So if a participant wants to be totally transparent, then they risk being targeted for extortion if they have a net worth too high. No reason to even mention the government because not everyone is more afraid of the taxman than they are of the local warlord, mafia or gang. On the other hand if a participant wants to be made safe just from the local mafia, gang or extortionist, they need to be able to program Bitshares to report to the tax agency and only to the tax agency, but not to anyone else, and only to report what is necessary to reduce their risk of an audit.

Can we have pursue liberty in the most intelligent ways possible? Can we manage risk for participants while also allowing participants to safely protest? Can we allow some participants to take more risks than others? We have to remember not all participants are in the same boat, not all have the same stuff to lose, and while everyone willing to take part in this experiment is taking risks, I do think we should take a risk based approach to determining design of certain features, or let the participants for example select the level of risk.

I'm not against KYC or AML, I'm not against paying taxes, but it's not because I always agree with the actions of my government or that I think the money is always well spent. The reason is because it reduces the risk of government interfering negatively in my life if I go along with the rules rather than if I don't. It's a matter of risk and consequence.

When it comes to privacy, the sort of privacy which lowers your risk with the least consequence is the programmable kind. The more you can configure it, the more you have access control, and access control is ultimately all privacy is. So if you determine the IRS can access your records but no one else, that should be an option, but if you determine not even the IRS can access your records, then you're protesting, and you should be able to make that decision if you're willing to accept the consequences. The point is the consequences faced by the tax protester have to be isolated and separated from the rest of the Bitshares network, in essence compartmentalize the consequences.

The governments basically exist to manage risks. We need them because they reduce the risk of us getting killed in a terrorist attack, or being a victim of crime. At the same time if we can reduce those risks on our own, we can achieve security without the need for their services most of the time, then you can protest in a way which increases security for the protesters. The point is not to sacrifice liberty or security, but to try to increase both in the same app. Depending on how you use the app should determine what you're willing to sacrifice in order to gain something else.

http://www.brighthubpm.com/risk-management/88566-tool-for-assessing-project-risk/
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_Matrix

Any controversial feature in Bitshares should have a warning in red letters that using this feature can bring possible negative consequences. The users of these features in my opinion deserve fair warning. This means the people who decide to keep all their trading activities transparent need to know the latest news and or frequency of extortion. They might want to know for example that there have been multiple extortion attempts against Roger Verr simply because too many of the wrong people knew exactly how much money he was worth and in what form it was.

At the same time a feature like totally anonymous transactions can put the participant at the risk of being harassed by the government, not just the IRS, but various different agencies, and it should also be in big red letters. Total anonymity does not increase security, it brings risk, just as not enough privacy brings risk.

So the recommended way to do things I would say is to be partially transparent. It can be known who you trade with, and why. The amounts you trade on the other hand have to be hidden. If you do decide to be anonymous it should at least be possible to have enough information to prove your innocence if you are harassed. You need a way to show you were not part of the conspiracy, and because the blockchain isn't transparent this responsibility will rest entirely on you, so you would have to expect to receive a knock on the door or some questions.

Every controversial feature has benefits and risks. The user needs to be made aware of the benefits and risks, and needs to know how to use these features responsibly so that they can have the optimal amount of liberty. As Bytemaster once said about decentralization, there is a sweet spot and if you have too much it can actually reduce your efficiency, but if you don't have enough then you're not resilient.

I can only imagine the hit "Telegram" is taking from the recent news where they were basically called out as "the" terrorist platform for communication. Fucking sad days man. The boot is getting closer and closer to my face every goddamn day and so few of the people I know afk even see it or care. That's why I spend most of my time with the cryptocurrency ecosystem. I just hope it doesn't end up being the reason why I'm in a fricken re-education camp in a few years. The good news is they have one really close to my Dad's house so he can visit I guess. =/

I'm here because BitShares can absolutely transform the way society functions, because we can render existing structures of control obsolete, because we have a chance to rewrite the rules of the game.

BitShares is a socio-political pioneer species in the present day wasteland of fractured communities, failed states, wars: both financial, physical, digital, and extending into the realm of thought itself.  We are among the first in a whole new species of organism, which holds the potential to restore balance.

I recognize that BitShares must provide valuable services, and be profitable, to continue growing and developing.  And although I know there are a number of community members who share the vision of life, liberty, and property for all... I often feel a great mist shrouds the eyes of many into confusing the marker with the game, as they seem primarily focused on profit alone.

Everyone has their own reasons for being here, and I see no reason why we can't all succeed in our aims together.

The financial world, the exchanges; these are currently churning through trillions, and it would likely benefit us to capture even a fraction of this, but personally I'm focused on other applications, other use-cases, and don't have a whole lot of interest in this arena, though I do think there's enormous potential in capturing this energy for other developments, as economic jiu jitsu, to power all manner of other projects.  However if we gain the world only to lose our soul, as they say, then we will have lost.

I generally feel that everyone is severely underestimating the population of the planet which is ready to throw off it's chains and turn a new page in human history.  These are the people I intend to reach, and the tools are almost there.

We can make BitShares better, and provide for a multitude of use cases.  As to the fee debate, my only desire is that I wish there were an elegant solution for providing regional fee scaling so citizens of countries like China, and the US, could be on a more level playing field.  Everyone would benefit.
